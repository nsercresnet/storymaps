<!--The soil samples of known volume taken from the core are first dried to determine the bulk density. Wet samples are placed in individually labeled tins, weighed, and then dried at 60 ℃ in a drying oven for 24-72 hours (or until a consistent dried weight is reached). After they are completely dry, they are re-weighed to determine dry weight of the soil sample. The photos below show the dried soil cylinders in a dessicator after the oven, which ensures the samples are fully dried before being re-weighed. Bulk density is written as the dry weight of soil divided by the known volume of the sample (grams per cm<sup>3</sup>). Low bulk density means there is not a lot of soil within the volume of core sampled, which means the soil is less densely packed and there are more air pockets. Soils with low bulk density often have high organic matter content and water-holding capacity (like a sponge!). -->
<p>Wet samples are placed in individually labeled tins, weighed, and then dried at 60 ℃ in a drying oven for 24-72 hours (or until a consistent dried weight is reached). After they are completely dry, they are re-weighed to determine dry weight of the soil sample. The images below show the dried soil cylinders in a desiccator, which allows the samples to cool down to room temperature without absorbing any moisture before being re-weighed. Bulk density is written as the dry weight of soil divided by the known volume of the sample (grams per cm<sup>3</sup>). Low bulk density means there is not a lot of soil within the volume of core sampled, which means the soil is less densely packed and there are more air pockets.

<!--After the soil samples are dried and bulk density is determined, the soil samples are often processed for loss-on-ignition (LOI), which is an estimate of how much ‘organic matter’ is a soil sample. Before the samples are put into the furnace, the soil sample needs to be crushed into a homogenous sample, often using a mortar and pestle. Depending on how much organic matter is in the sample, this can be time consuming.-->

<!--LOI involves combusting the soil sample at a high temperature (550 ℃) in a muffle furnace for 4 hours. Before the soil samples are put into the furnace, they are placed in a ceramic crucible and weighed to a consistent starting weight. After the samples are combusted, they are re-weighed to determine how much mass was lost, which corresponds to how much organic matter was burnt off from the sample and is represented by ‘% organic matter’ of the sample. Sometimes accidents happen but often duplicate or triplicate samples are done for LOI, so it can take a significant amount of time to get through that many samples. Soil carbon scientists often use different methods for LOI, which may affect the comparison of results between datasets. As there is no standard method, it is recommended to report and be consistent in three parameters: ignition temperature, exposure time, and starting weight.-->
