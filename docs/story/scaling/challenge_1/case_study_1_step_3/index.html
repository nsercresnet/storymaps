				<h4 id="step-3--processing-of-cores-in-the-lab">Step 3:  Processing of cores in the lab</h4>
<p>Once back in the lab, processing the core starts. The cores are photographed and different features like soil colour and texture are described and recorded. Then cores are divided into different increments depending on the goals of the study. For this study, 5 cm increments were chosen for a total of 10 per 50 cm core, which means that 360 individual samples were processed! When dividing cores, a compression factor should be used to adjust the increment length based on the compaction measured in the field. Compaction is often assumed equal across the entirety of the core, unless compaction is measured periodically throughout the core extraction process in the field.</p>

<!--To calculate how much organic carbon is in a core, two measurements are needed - ‘bulk density’ and ‘organic carbon content’ or ‘% organic carbon’. Core increments are usually sampled for bulk density first, which is a measure of the dry weight of soil within a known volume of the core. In the photo below, a metal cylinder was inserted into the centre of each 5 cm increment. The soil sample was extracted using a syringe plunger and then dried in an oven (see Step 4). Often the same soil sample is also used to determine the organic carbon content of the increment, but others can be cut from the core and stored until they are processed.-->

<p>Once processing is done, any remaining core segments are often archived and frozen for future analyses. Freezer and refrigerator space is a very important factor to consider when taking soil cores and designing the field study, as cores should be kept cold (&lt; 4℃) to prevent decomposition of organic matter by microbes.</p>
