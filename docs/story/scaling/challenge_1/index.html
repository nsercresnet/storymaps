<!-- Scaling requires data. For many ecosystem services, data is collected through field sampling. Many challenges exist when conducting field work to collect data, including:

- The trade-off between the number of data points needed and the time and resources available to collect, process, and analyze field samples.

- Thorough background research is needed to choose a proper sampling scheme for the ecological questions being explored.

- Data collected for one study’s questions may not be applicable to a study that aims to scale ecosystem services up (or down).

- Methodologies used to collect field data may not be the same between similar studies exploring the same ecosystem service.

- Unexpected situations often occur while conducting field or lab work (e.g. equipment breaking or weather events) and often information can be missing from datasets.

- The heterogeneity of the environment does not guarantee that data points collected reflect the true spatial and temporal variability that exists in the ecosystem being studied.

This section will describe the challenges and best practices of collecting soil carbon data from two different ecosystems \- salt marshes along the Bay of Fundy and forests and agricultural land in the Northwest Territories.”-->
<p>When studying ecosystems, scientists often collect data in the field. For example, soil samples can be taken in the field to estimate how much carbon there is in a particular location. Often, we use local field data together with models to understand what may be happening over a larger area.</p>
<p>Below we show two case studies where NSERC ResNet scientists collected and processed soil carbon data in two ecosystems: salt marshes along the Bay of Fundy and forests and farmlands in the Northwest Territories.</p>

<!--Four study sites in the Upper Bay of Fundy along the Cumberland Basin were chosen to represent salt marshes at different stages of restoration:  Converse - newly restored, Aulac - restored over 10 years ago, John Lusby - passively restored over 50 years ago, and Wood Point Rest Stop - natural reference site. Sites were chosen to be close to one another (<10 km apart) so environmental conditions like tides and weather were similar between sites. -->

<p>Cores were collected using a gouge auger (images below), one of the many types of ‘corers’ available to use by soil carbon scientists. Other coring types include the ‘Russian peat corer’ (extracts half a core) and manual extraction (hammering a sharpened tube into the ground). Each of these methods will create different levels of core ‘compaction’, which can affect the overall length of the core and influence the estimate of how much soil organic carbon is contained within each core. Depending on the length of the core, the process of pushing the coring device into the ground and extracting a core can be physically demanding and often requires teamwork.</p>

<p>Transport and handling of cores after they are taken out of the ground is another important consideration for field work. Sometimes cores are cut apart and sub-sampled in the field, and other times cores are packed in rigid plastic shells, wrapped in plastic-wrap, and refrigerated or frozen before being processed back in the lab. In salt marshes, researchers often have to walk far into study sites across uneven terrain with heavy equipment (like the corer and a cooler) to retrieve cores and bring them back.</p>

<p>Once back in the lab, processing the core starts. The cores are photographed and different features like soil colour and texture are described and recorded. Then cores are divided into different increments depending on the goals of the study. For this study, 5 cm increments were chosen for a total of 10 per 50 cm core, which means that 360 individual samples were processed! When dividing cores, a compression factor should be used to adjust the increment length based on the compaction measured in the field. Compaction is often assumed equal across the entirety of the core, unless compaction is measured periodically throughout the core extraction process in the field.</p>

<!--To calculate how much organic carbon is in a core, two measurements are needed - ‘bulk density’ and ‘organic carbon content’ or ‘% organic carbon’. Core increments are usually sampled for bulk density first, which is a measure of the dry weight of soil within a known volume of the core. In the photo below, a metal cylinder was inserted into the centre of each 5 cm increment. The soil sample was extracted using a syringe plunger and then dried in an oven (see Step 4). Often the same soil sample is also used to determine the organic carbon content of the increment, but others can be cut from the core and stored until they are processed.-->

<p>Once processing is done, any remaining core segments are often archived and frozen for future analyses. Freezer and refrigerator space is a very important factor to consider when taking soil cores and designing the field study, as cores should be kept cold (&lt; 4℃) to prevent decomposition of organic matter by microbes.</p>

<!--The soil samples of known volume taken from the core are first dried to determine the bulk density. Wet samples are placed in individually labeled tins, weighed, and then dried at 60 ℃ in a drying oven for 24-72 hours (or until a consistent dried weight is reached). After they are completely dry, they are re-weighed to determine dry weight of the soil sample. The photos below show the dried soil cylinders in a dessicator after the oven, which ensures the samples are fully dried before being re-weighed. Bulk density is written as the dry weight of soil divided by the known volume of the sample (grams per cm<sup>3</sup>). Low bulk density means there is not a lot of soil within the volume of core sampled, which means the soil is less densely packed and there are more air pockets. Soils with low bulk density often have high organic matter content and water-holding capacity (like a sponge!). -->

<!--LOI involves combusting the soil sample at a high temperature (550 ℃) in a muffle furnace for 4 hours. Before the soil samples are put into the furnace, they are placed in a ceramic crucible and weighed to a consistent starting weight. After the samples are combusted, they are re-weighed to determine how much mass was lost, which corresponds to how much organic matter was burnt off from the sample and is represented by ‘% organic matter’ of the sample. Sometimes accidents happen but often duplicate or triplicate samples are done for LOI, so it can take a significant amount of time to get through that many samples. Soil carbon scientists often use different methods for LOI, which may affect the comparison of results between datasets. As there is no standard method, it is recommended to report and be consistent in three parameters: ignition temperature, exposure time, and starting weight.-->

<!--Once bulk density and % organic matter are determined, the ‘organic carbon density’ of each increment of the core can be estimated. Often % organic matter (%OM) is converted to % organic carbon (%OC) in salt marshes using a known conversion equation published in the scientific literature or roughly estimated by simply dividing %OM by 2. Some studies choose to determine the exact amount of organic carbon (%OC) in their samples by conducting ‘elemental analysis’ or sending the samples to another lab to do this analysis. More and more studies are now sending at least a subset of samples away to determine their own %OM-to-%OC conversion equations. Either way, this step involves more time to process samples or more money to pay for the analysis. In addition, soil samples should be treated to remove any inorganic carbon so elemental analysis results only reflect total organic carbon. The figure below is pulled directly from Craft et al. 1991 <a href="../references/">[1]</a> and shows the relationship between %OM and %OC for brackish and salt marsh sediments in North Carolina. For the data presented below in this case study, a local equation for %OM-to%OC was developed using data from sites located in the Upper Bay of Fundy. -->

<!--Once %OC of the increment is determined, this can be multiplied by the bulk density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) to determine the organic carbon density of the core. Organic carbon density (g OC/cm<sup>3</sup>) is then multiplied by the height of each increment (5 cm in this example) to determine the amount of carbon within each core depth increment (g OC/cm<sup>2</sup>). Then all increments are added together to get the total ‘soil organic carbon stock’ throughout the core’s depth. This organic carbon stock (g OC/cm<sup>2</sup> to 50 cm depth) can be scaled up to larger areas and compared to other studies. A common unit for carbon stock is megagrams (or tonnes) per hectare (Mg/ha).

<h4 id="step-1-choosing-representative-sites-and-study-areas">Step 1: Choosing representative sites and study areas</h4>
<p>We partnered with communities in the Northwest Territories, Canada such as Kakisa (shown here) to understand carbon and fertility trade-offs associated with agricultural cultivation of the boreal forest.</p>

<p>In 2019, a soil sampling effort was conducted to assess the soil fertility and carbon content of sites that communities were interested in for agricultural development. Study sites were selected across a gradient of potential agriculture suitability ranging from class 3 (potentially the most suitable for agriculture) to class 7 (likely unsuitable for agriculture). Sites were also selected based on input from local community members.</p>

<p>In 2021, a soil collection effort was undertaken to understand how soil fertility and carbon change between three different land use types: pre-cultivated forest soil, active agricultural soils, and abandoned agricultural soils. In partnership with seven farmers, 22 total sites were sampled.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-data-interpretation">Step 4: Data interpretation</h4>
<p>Based on the soil data we collected and the results of a global synthesis of studies, we found that soil organic carbon stocks significantly decline with increasing time since cultivation. This is concerning as the boreal forest represents the largest pool of terrestrial carbon.</p>

    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Image by David Bysouth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also found differing relationships between soil organic carbon and soil fertility in our study sites. In agricultural soils (both active and abandoned) soil fertility and soil carbon are positively correlated. In pre-cultivation or undisturbed sites, soil fertility and soil carbon are negatively correlated. This negative correlation is important from a land management perspective as we can target areas of high fertility, but low soil carbon to limit potential carbon losses.</p>

<p>We were able to use the soil data to create a map that highlights areas of lower amounts of soil organic carbon (shown in white) and high macronutrient fertility (larger circles). This serves as a preliminary land management tool that can help communities make decisions that limit carbon losses upon cultivation.</p>

<!-- Collecting field data for scaling requires:
1. Funding and resources. 
2. Background research to plan the most effective sampling scheme to capture as much variability as possible. 
3. A network of researchers, stakeholders, and community members using standard methodologies to allow for the comparison of data across time and space. 
4. Collaboration with people using the data (e.g. modelers) to help identify the type of data that will be needed before it is collected. 

Spending the time planning your field work is essential. Integration of modelers in this planning is even more important if the data is intended to be used in future studies of scaling. Planning ensures unexpected events and missing data can be dealt with and will not influence the overall dataset. -->
<!--Field data challenges and opportunities -->
<p>Field sampling is important for assessing many ecosystem services. However, it is important to have the following points in mind before engaging in field data collection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carry out substantial background research to choose the most effective sampling methods based on the questions you are trying to answer.</li>
<li>Balance the number of samples you need with the funding and resources you have to collect, process, and analyze them.</li>
<li>Different studies may use different methods, even when studying the same ecosystem service, so using standard methodologies where possible allows for easier comparison of data across time and space.</li>
<li>Since ecosystems often have high spatial and temporal variability, the data collected might not fully capture all the changes and differences happening over time and across the area being studied.</li>
<li>Data collected for one study might not work for another study that is trying to look at ecosystem services on a different scale. Integration of modellers in field planning is important if the data is intended to be used in future studies of scaling.</li>
<li>Unexpected things, like equipment breaking or bad weather, can happen during field or lab work causing missing data. Spending the time planning ensures unexpected events and missing data can be dealt with and will not influence the overall dataset.</li>
