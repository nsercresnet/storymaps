  ## Challenge: Model comparisons
    
  ### Case study 
  
  Here, we compared the Human footprint at three scales: Global (Williams et al., 2020), National (Hirsh-Pearson et al., 2022), and Provincial. The human footprint is a cumulative index that quantifies the extent and the intensity of human pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity.

  This sample represents the state of human pressure in the northeast of British Columbia. From coarse (global) to detailed (provincial) resolution, we identify how roads are represented to different extents. Regarding complexities, with 8 mapped variables, the global model captures a broad perspective of human interventions in which roads and settlements are the most visible features. The map is improved with the national model, which integrates 12 layers, providing the first appearance of oil and gas infrastructure and mining. The provincial map, which incorporates 16 layers, shows a comprehensive state of the human footprint, including seismic lines, oil and gas wells, and infrastructure, even recreational features.
