  ### Introduction

  `[This section is under construction and will be updated after the AGM; however, we provide notes of our current thoughts]`

  There is a trade-off between the need for field data but the time and funding needed to collect and process field samples. When collecting samples in the field it is important to consider...

  - Heterogeneity of the environment
  - Background research needed to choose a proper sampling scheme
  - Balancing within site and between site variability
  - Ideal sampling vs what's actually feasible (*e.g.*, resources, time, costs, administrative)
  - Cost - collection and analysis (lab work)
  - Unexpected situations (*e.g.*, equipment breaking) - need to be flexible (best laid plans, often fail?)
  - Explain what those N/As are about (missing data)
  - Physical work / bugs
  - Environmental/ecological challenges (bears, flooding, fire, tides, navigation)
  - Different methodologies used (how to scale up when the data collected uses different methods - Apples to Oranges?)

  There are many carbon maps for Canada (*e.g.*, [WWF](https://wwf.ca/carbon-stocks/)); however, it's important to understand where these carbon stock numbers come from.
